This program performs the chroma key operation to replace images with Green Screens on an input
using two different methods


Method 1 Utilize a user-defined distance threshold from the
         chromakey value as a discriminator


Method 2 Devise a method that to determine the chromakey mask
         that doesn't require a user-input threshold
