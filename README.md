Haotong Fu (Mark)'s Repository
Welcome to my github repository!

These are the two projects I have worked on independently (I am not allowed to share any codes from internships):

1: Chromakey Image Processor
▪ Developed an optimized algorithm via C++ to accurately detect and replace greenscreen backgrounds in images, reducing the detection error rate from 12% to 0.2% over 7 rigorous test cases

2: Exam Scheduler
▪ Built an exam scheduling program in C++ utilizing AVL trees, backtracking, and recursion to efficiently assign students’ exams to timeslots, ensuring no conflicting schedules

3: Customzed Chatgpt - Resume Refiner (Working in Progress)
